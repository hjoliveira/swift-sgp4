# Phase 2 Implementation Status

## What Was Accomplished ✅

### 1. Swift 6.x Installation
- Successfully installed Swift 6.0.2 on Ubuntu 24.04
- Location: `/usr/local/swift-6.0.2/`
- Verified with `swift --version`

### 2. Code Structure Implementation
- **SGP4Constants.swift** (120 lines) - All physical/mathematical constants
  - WGS-84 Earth parameters
  - Gravitational harmonics (J2, J3, J4)
  - Conversion factors and thresholds

- **SGP4State.swift** (283 lines) - Internal state management
  - TLE parsing and conversion to internal units
  - Pre-computation of trigonometric values
  - Drag coefficient calculations (C1-C5, D2-D4)
  - Secular rate calculations

- **SGP4Propagator.swift** (298 lines) - Main algorithm
  - 6-step propagation algorithm
  - Kepler equation solver
  - Coordinate transformations

### 3. Build Success
- ✅ Code compiles with **0 code warnings**
- ✅ Only 1 Info.plist warning (expected for SPM)
- ✅ All TLE parsing tests pass (18/18)
- ✅ All TLE validation tests pass (16/16)

### 4. Tests Enabled
- Enabled 5 near-earth SGP4 tests
- Created comprehensive test documentation (TEST_STATUS.md)
- Tests use Vallado's official verification data

## Current Issues ❌

### Test Results:
- **Passing**: 34/38 tests (TLE parsing and validation)
- **Failing**: 5/38 SGP4 propagation tests
- **Skipped**: 10/38 tests (1 deep-space SDP4, 9 coordinate conversion)

### Specific Failures:

1. **testSatellite00005** - Position/velocity completely wrong
   - Expected X: 2328.97 km → Got: 7245.24 km (3x error!)
   - Expected Y: -5995.22 km → Got: 281.50 km (wrong sign and magnitude!)
   - Velocity values also completely wrong

2. **testSatellite06251** - Semi-latus rectum negative error
   - Propagation fails during calculation
   - Suggests eccentricity > 1 after long-period corrections

3. **testSatellite11801** - Actually IS deep-space (period 1436 min)
   - Test description says "near-geostationary" but period > 225 minutes
   - SDP4 not implemented, so correctly skipped

4. **testLowEccentricityOrbit** - Semi-latus rectum negative error

5. **testLongTermPropagationAccuracy** - Semi-latus rectum negative error

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Algorithm Implementation Bugs**
   - Position/velocity calculations are fundamentally wrong
   - Not just numerical precision - values are off by 3x or have wrong signs
   - Suggests errors in coordinate transformations or perturbation calculations

2. **Long-Period Perturbation Errors**
   - Multiple tests fail with "semi-latus rectum is negative"
   - This means `el2 = axn² + ayn² > 1` (eccentricity > 1 invalid)
   - Bug in Lyddane modifications or eccentricity component calculations

3. **Initialization Issues**
   - Semi-major axis calculation may be incorrect
   - Mean motion recovery formula needs verification against reference

## Debugging Approach Needed

### Downloaded Resources:
- ✅ Official Vallado C++ reference code from Celestrak
- Location: `/tmp/cpp/SGP4/`
- ✅ Brandon Rhodes python-sgp4 (reference implementation)

### Required Steps:

1. **Line-by-line comparison with Vallado C++ code**
   - Compare initialization in `sgp4init()`
   - Compare propagation in `sgp4()`
   - Verify all formulas match exactly

2. **Specific areas to check:**
   - Semi-major axis calculation (`a0dp` formula)
   - Mean motion recovery (`n0dp` calculation)
   - Eccentricity components (`axn`, `ayn`) in long-period terms
   - Short-period perturbations
   - Coordinate transformation from orbital to TEME frame

3. **Test with simpler case:**
   - Try circular orbit (e≈0) first
   - Verify epoch (t=0) matches exactly before testing t>0

## What Works

- ✅ TLE parsing is perfect (all tests pass)
- ✅ Code compiles cleanly
- ✅ Structure and organization are good
- ✅ Test framework is set up correctly
- ✅ Constants appear correct (from Vallado's spec)

## What Doesn't Work

- ❌ Core SGP4 propagation algorithm has major bugs
- ❌ Need detailed comparison with reference implementation
- ❌ May need to translate Vallado C++ code section-by-section

## Time Estimate

Based on the complexity:
- **Line-by-line debugging**: 4-6 hours
- **Algorithm corrections**: 2-3 hours
- **Testing and validation**: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 7-11 hours of focused work

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Compare SGP4State initialization with Vallado's `sgp4init()`
2. **Then**: Compare propagate() method with Vallado's `sgp4()`
3. **Finally**: Fix bugs one by one, testing after each fix

## Files to Review

From Vallado C++ code:
- `/tmp/cpp/SGP4/SGP4.cpp` - Main algorithm
- `/tmp/cpp/SGP4/SGP4.h` - Function signatures
- `/tmp/cpp/TestSGP4/` - Test cases and expected outputs

## Conclusion

Phase 2 is **80% complete**:
- ✅ All infrastructure done
- ✅ All supporting code done
- ✅ Algorithm structure in place
- ❌ Algorithm implementation has bugs that need systematic debugging

The implementation needs careful comparison with the reference code to identify and fix the calculation errors. The structure and approach are correct - it's the mathematical details that need correction.
