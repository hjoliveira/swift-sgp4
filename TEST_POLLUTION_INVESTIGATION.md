# Test Pollution Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

**Good News**: There is **NO test pollution** issue. Each test runs in complete isolation.

**Bad News**: The SGP4 implementation has **accuracy bugs** that cause it to fail for certain satellites, which is why adding new test cases appeared to cause problems.

---

## What Happened

When I added two new test cases (satellites 16925 and 22312), the test suite went from:
- **Before**: 38 tests, 1 failure (unrelated CoordinateConversion test)
- **After**: 40 tests, 26 failures

This made it appear that my new tests were "polluting" the existing tests.

---

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Test Isolation Check

I ran tests individually vs. together:

```
✅ testSatellite00005 alone: PASSES
✅ testSatellite06251 alone: PASSES
❌ testSatellite16925 alone: FAILS (produces wrong values)
✅ testSatellite00005 + testSatellite16925 together: 00005 still PASSES
```

**Conclusion**: No pollution - each test uses its own SGP4Propagator instance.

### Step 2: Implementation Debug

Added debug logging to SGP4Propagator:

```
[SGP4] Init for NORAD 16925: n0=15.64159219, e0=0.0012753, i0=51.6361  ✓ Correct
[SGP4] Propagate for NORAD 16925 at t=0.0: m0=2.09..., omega0=4.18...  ✓ Correct
Computed Position: (-3943.62, 5489.86, 7.17)
Expected Position: (5559.12, -11941.04, -19.41)  ❌ WAY OFF!
```

The TLE is parsed correctly, all input parameters are correct, but the output is wrong by ~10,000 km!

### Step 3: Verification Against Reference Data

Checked tcppver.out (official SGP4 verification data):

```
Satellite 16925 at t=0: (5559.12, -11941.04, -19.41) ← Official expected value
Swift SGP4 produces:   (-3943.62, 5489.86, 7.17)   ← Implementation bug
```

The computed values don't match ANY satellite in the verification data - they're genuinely wrong.

## Root Cause

**The Swift SGP4 implementation has accuracy/correctness bugs that affect certain satellites.**

### Working Satellites:
- ✅ **00005**: e=0.186, i=34.27°, n=10.82 revs/day (highly elliptical)
- ✅ **06251**: e=0.003, i=58.06°, n=15.56 revs/day (LEO, normal drag)

### Failing Satellites:
- ❌ **16925**: e=0.001275, i=51.64°, n=15.64 revs/day (LEO, moderate drag)
- ❌ **22312**: e=0.0258, i=62.15°, n=15.22 revs/day (LEO, **very high drag** BSTAR=0.00021906)

### Pattern Analysis:

The failing satellites have characteristics that may trigger edge cases:
1. **Very low eccentricity** (16925: e=0.001275)
2. **Very high drag coefficient** (22312: BSTAR=0.00021906)
3. Both are LEO satellites with similar mean motions (~15 revs/day)

## Why 26 Failures?

Each new test satellite (16925, 22312) has multiple test points (3 positions + 3 velocities each), and each assertion counts as a failure:

- testSatellite16925: 6 position assertions + 6 velocity assertions at 3 time points = 18 failures
- testSatellite22312: 4 position assertions + 4 velocity assertions at 2 time points = 8 failures
- **Total**: 26 failures

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Don't Add These Tests Yet
Remove satellites 16925 and 22312 from the test suite until the SGP4 implementation bugs are fixed.

**Pros**: Test suite remains "green"
**Cons**: Limited test coverage hides implementation problems

### Option 2: Add As Skipped Tests
Add the tests but mark them with `throw XCTSkip("Known issue with satellite 16925")`

**Pros**: Documents known issues, easy to unskip when fixed
**Cons**: Doesn't help find the bug

### Option 3: Add As Expected-Failure Tests
Add the tests with very large tolerances or custom assertions that document the expected incorrect behavior.

**Pros**: Tracks the bug, prevents regressions
**Cons**: Messy test code

### Option 4: Fix The SGP4 Implementation (Recommended)
Investigate and fix the accuracy bugs in the SGP4 propagator.

**Areas to investigate**:
1. Drag coefficient handling for very high BSTAR values
2. Eccentricity handling for near-circular orbits (e < 0.002)
3. Numerical precision in intermediate calculations
4. Comparison with reference implementation (python-sgp4)

---

## Current Status

- ✅ Investigation complete
- ✅ Root cause identified (implementation bugs, not test pollution)
- ❌ Tests reverted (removed new test cases)
- ⏳ SGP4 implementation needs debugging

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Keep test suite with only working satellites (00005, 06251)
2. **Short-term**: Compare Swift implementation line-by-line with python-sgp4 reference
3. **Medium-term**: Fix identified bugs and add comprehensive test coverage
4. **Long-term**: Implement SDP4 for deep-space satellites

---

## Files Modified During Investigation

- `SwiftSGP4/SGP4Propagator.swift` - Added/removed debug logging
- `SwiftSGP4Tests/SGP4PropagatorTests.swift` - Added/removed diagnostic tests
- All changes have been reverted

## Conclusion

**There is no test pollution.** The Swift SGP4 implementation simply doesn't work correctly for all satellites yet. The implementation should be debugged and fixed before adding more test cases from the Vallado reference data.
